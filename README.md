# simpledbi
A simple Database Interface using TypeScript annotations.

The goal is to write raw SQL (no ORM) and have SQL queries bound to a function execution. It is heavily inspired from [JDBI](http://jdbi.org/)

To use it, you should use one of the real database bindings such as `simpledbi-sqlite3`
(currently, it's the only binding available BTW, PR are welcome).

See [SQLite Example](sqlite3/README.md)

## Currenly at the stage of a prototype - comments welcome!
